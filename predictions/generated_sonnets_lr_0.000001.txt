Those lips that Love's own hand did make
Breathed forth the sound that said "I hate"
To me that languished for her sake;
It is only fitting that I bestow
And give to the finish to her beautiful name.
The last two lines of Love's daughter's rhyme are, from her own point of view, frighteningly similar to the lines that she did use, which were,:
But I loved him more than these vain notes
We have joined.
What is the meaning of this the last line of her first verse? If Fanny could have seen the result of this she would have probably died of grief. For what has happened to our daughter, and how can we answer for her last sad verse?

By DIE GARETH.

THE children are beginning to suspect that the world's doom has at last arrived, and that no one has the right to predict the date that it will fall. But it seems altogether too late for Fanny's verse and the last two lines of Lady Bertram's, and though it is only now that the fear begins to bite, no opinion is entertained in the country that was entertained before: it is a vote of no confidence to approve of Rose herself, because her last verse, as now, uses that very sort of croaking, sometimes like an Irish gof, which her daughter finds

Poor soul, the center of my sinful earth,
Pressed with these rebel powers that thee array,
Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth,
As the every-day day to day fruit of the earth;
Thy proud tree, the one star that shines,
The forest, thou hateful, the bitter wound of my loins.
Now leave me as I sleep and do no harm again.
To Triptolemus, ap. C. 180. "Who else but Tiombano, the snake-god?
His tale is said to be the centre of the sordid history of Rome.
'Tis said of him that he had met
A very fortunate story throughout his life.
The story was soon told
That he had been born for the purpose
Of punishing some offence." Literary Lives of Ovid. A New Translation By C. W. Robertson (Oxford: V&R) 1971.
PRAISE OF KONPUHL "For whom every day is but a long season
And not a holiday rest, to the soul of man.
As Amphiaraus, the sun, is seen no more
For his travail's end;" or "Heaven told me so,"
"Till what sun not seen till his last?" or, "Thou art still a son?"
"Last, through whose light

My love is as a fever, longing still
For that which longer nurseth the disease,
Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,
Till at last I hear, hollow and febrile
There are no other tears, nor much to be done,
Our love alas I too must experience.
Little can any one tell what will come of this
Though
That I unmindful should add to the stale ones
And drape the thatch-embroidered tarred
The air remains still the same;
Then I fly from the green; see where I could hide,
But I hear, deep up the forest, the neighing
Aether much petrifying, or forgotten
Plumes grow rank beside the stalks.
Then once more, gently by an awkward slope
As they close, there appeared the child
For one thing they have failed to fulfil:
Her name is Motto, what wants now to crown it
Bade me shout there, oh let her shout through.
If the word passage of it were shameful,
I am thaire creature when sent
To re-enter the house; as soon as I
Enters the lower room upon the reclining ground
Ought not my request of three loaves
Thus to strain to the gusty breeze?
Should not they with hatchet-thrust

O me, what eyes hath love put in my head,
Which have no correspondence with true sight!
Or if they have, where is my judgment fled,
To judge so grave a question of love?"
"I shall find out—how?" said the Duke, walking forwards.
"Take your talents, Corund, or go to America."
"I will go to America—oh! my Queen! you are as beautiful as the stars, my friend; but I must tell her of my only resolution,
I will go to America."
"Nor shall I press you, you are well educated; so go on then, then. Go to the box, be sure to find something to play upon: for you are an excellent mariner, you are my friend, very wealthy with the Black Sea treasury; and yet, hark, at this time, and circumstances, you will wish to make your first great appeal and discovery of your Lady, if only she will listen; if she will hear you! come, come to dinner with me, for I am about to begin a new fish-cookery with Venus by the Court cook."
"But I have an appointment with your wife's family?" said the Duke.
"Oh, no! but any time you would, you may have our letters and cook-books provided for your enjoyment."
"I do not know of any such thing

Canst thou, O cruel, say I love thee not
When I against myself with thee partake?
Do I not think on thee when I forgot
I loved thee; or when I feel I find that I have
Aphrodite in my house?'


'Nay, yes, thou a daughter of thy father;

And that I am her happiness, her love I bear;

While others, husbands themselves, thy shamed?

My love for thee O fair Venus; three times

I did withstand thy dauntless ardour,

Which so quick? Thy flame burnt us both;

Him, because he loved vain, and me,

For aught not so oft; but, return all I said,

Thou wilt and will to the love thou wouldst

Sell us, which the lady holdth precious,

That holy, faithful, and true love will be kept.'

Grimacing his heart, as he spoke, he reddened.

'Why didst thou act thus upon me?

As though both of us cruel now,

Who, me thinking equal, part for it,

But causest our hearts to adore!

So on very quick passion itself

Shall claim our life's delight, if on command

We win our

O, from what power hast thou this powerful might
With insufficiency my heart to sway?
To make me give the lie to my true sight,
Was done in the main at the inquest
Where the traitor lies hid. His god
Perishes in the public pillory, On the field of honor
He sends before he sleeps, Unfettered and unsullied
His friendliest and most noble voice.
The King was grieving till he was changed
Within days to the peaceable figure he seems.
Remorse of time like a wound were more than now;
A terrible condition of the heart to endure
Suffice nothing near to warrant a God.
Although the battle may turn against us,
The conflict still bear us about with triumph.
If thou hold'st in thy strength and decry'st
All insuperable perplexities,
Of thy conversation, fancy, art's proud deeds,
Then wayfarer, with bold feet and gentle heart,
For these is our commonwealth, and left here
With thee and thy mother for servants, Let us fare
Than a great wanderer to other wildernesses.
What a strange commonwealth was left by the race
Of barbarians, and the friendliest of all!
Generous and merry are our people, I stand
To see you just, and you to me, I shall

Love is too young to know what conscience is;
Yet who knows not conscience is born of love?
Then, gentle cheater, urge not my amiss,
This one godless rascal, my captive,
Will caress us by night, be blissful, and purr;
Do your good, do your word.
There as much as howls in the angry winds,
Some from guilt, some from malice, some from vile
Punctures fleck the room, then nip and crumble.
Happy above, and happy below, I see
When noble blossom blossom the way of virtue;
Delicate for a grace that only cares
For the two together.
Mr. Barclay gets another son
For he has the triple right of father,
The addition of Mr. Smith too.
To him will not may seem more, and to me
More greatly.
Mr. Barclay grows indifferent. With the exception
Of brawls upon deck, my Mr. Monckton said
That young swans were passing happily on
The board, where three little eyes looked on them
Having revealed one permanent thrill in them.
Take care of those! It will be hard to move
What light can upon the pallid clouds above
That is not the dominion of the interminable,
This earth-dwelling quality.
So

In loving thee thou know'st I am forsworn,
But thou art twice forsworn, to me love swearing;
In act thy bed-vow broke, and new faith torn,
So let me soften thy sickness. So shalt thou lov thyself.
And indeed, maiden, if thine ear were to hear,
And thy heart to have pleasure in my would
Given she was, I would neither so sacrifice,
Nor drink of thy deceit with borrowed dose.
To preserve the body of thy dear child,
Because of thine adultery calles forth a grudge,
I well, for Gods name, wot still I live.
One Rose was I from devouring a viper,
That prayed rather of the ritual for clean garment
And a broken lustre to die. 13
I, honour's-priest, had ceased to weep and wail.
Plently sick, such a disease could not have caused
My defence, woe to the affliction,
That sealed thine ending, would but kill my touch,
Though to seek it would be too thin.
Since thou, too late dooth wilt call an end,
Woe to be unwed and illegitimate;
For stony death, my strength of bodily strength,
Decked me out the lair for the grievous hurt.
Regard not thy bliss to rob, nor thy patient,

Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep.
A maid of Dian's this advantage found,
And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep.

So creep you not forth on the flood of my day

From the oed if I have my pains to contend with,

The expitat dames of Bethmode remain,

Gaps to run to, if they thought to prosper

Haly, harm that might spring up on two a sombre day

When the blithe bird yielded her wings to the fair,

To be set down a little from the brow at rest,

To tell the mischief and call that guest and play

To another where he showed the common arm.

But, so great a thing is remedied, I leafe

I stop your resting; it is only for the work.

I had my forgetfulness to mend, be all my soul

Like green sorrow is all the sport of imagination.

But, as you could well be cursed for another man's fault,

And if I do not deceive you with bad work then

But put it all, I will last you but a while;

I will not force into your act

Holly, which often brings in malicious ends.

Love, below your wise works will

The little love-god, lying once asleep,
Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,
Whilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to keep
Bought a silken cloak to catch the warmth of his grace.
Dreaming of confound'd and unhunger'd despair,
Above him fell his golden shell of gold,
Snatching while he slept the spittle that fell in his door.
At the same time two sacred angels' fair voices
Shaped his inward aid, by degrees the sage's man.
They kindled the knight's (not his kin's) blaze;
And noble was their endeavour! certain his three friends
Were friends and never could be enemies.
Night falling was as before when I led you up to the hill
Of priceless Alsinore, the flint-like while I
Old Bilbo mus'd with his bow and sharpened his quiver.
'Can I say the secret to warn the giant and his friends
To fleer no farther under their brows?
My prophecies shall convince them of all, for then
A day shall come when he will see the whole world gladden
With the glow of peace because the old battle was over.'
[Enter Frodo]
Frodo :
A merry time we had this winter, and the hours were well spent.

When my love swears that she is made of truth,
I do believe her, though I know she lies,
That she might think me some untutored youth,
That uses her, but I find her, that she has
The whole lady, and I know of no more
Than I did trust in her. It has not been:
Scornful words with the blush of passion
The chains and locks that bind the wounded which
Delicate the locks that bind them:  Your eyes
And your hands are so dedicated to you, that I would
Draw them from you, and look at another
As lover as me, to find his salvation, of whom
I knew him from a distance, and at that
Defective, could believe anything worthy of the
Heart. Here's the guy who used to talk about his eyes as
money. Let's stop it already. There's not much room
To stand on some of these guys, if my aim is to befriend
The people who might have faith in me, or the story they
Published, or the truth they tell. Which is the story
I have in my heart to believe, that everyone will be,
That if no one kisses me, it will be by an angel.


11
Two loves I have, of comfort and despair,
That like two spirits do suggest me still.
My better angel is a man right fair,
Who if I am like-minded will no longer tell
Of mine infancy and misfortunes, And pity his troubled wife and daughters.
Since I spoke love of you is forgotten;
Say well also of me, brother, seeing ye is
My dearest. Such is the wedding you now.
