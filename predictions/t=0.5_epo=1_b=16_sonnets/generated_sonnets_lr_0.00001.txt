Those lips that Love's own hand did make
Breathed forth the sound that said "I hate"
To me that languished for her sake;
And the sweet sound of her voice, like the
Which the hand that did make it made,
Made me hate her, and I loved her not.


1
Poor soul, the center of my sinful earth,
Pressed with these rebel powers that thee array,
Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth,
And suffer thyself to be the prey of the cruel?
How dost thou pine in thy own place, and seek to be
A prey of the cruel, and the prey of the cruel?


2
My love is as a fever, longing still
For that which longer nurseth the disease,
Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,
And in the sickness that feeds it, the best.


3
O me, what eyes hath love put in my head,
Which have no correspondence with true sight!
Or if they have, where is my judgment fled,
Which is the rule of my thoughts, and my knowledge?
For I know not what I know, nor what I know,
But I know not what I know, but I know what I know.


4
Canst thou, O cruel, say I love thee not
When I against myself with thee partake?
Do I not think on thee when I forgot thee?


5
O, from what power hast thou this powerful might
With insufficiency my heart to sway?
To make me give the lie to my true sight,
And to make me look upon my own shame.



6
Love is too young to know what conscience is;
Yet who knows not conscience is born of love?
Then, gentle cheater, urge not my amiss,
Nor do I see thee to be a little friend;
And, if thou art a little friend, I will not be a little
A little friend.


7
In loving thee thou know'st I am forsworn,
But thou art twice forsworn, to me love swearing;
In act thy bed-vow broke, and new faith torn;
And thou, in thy sorrow, dost take thy vows;
And thou, in thy sorrow, dost not think thou art.


8
Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep.
A maid of Dian's this advantage found,
And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep
And so in his soul did he burn,
And so he was left in the sweetest of sleep
And so he did sleep, and so he did sleep.
And in the morning the maid was glad,
And the maid was glad, and the maid was glad,


9
The little love-god, lying once asleep,
Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,
Whilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to keep
Were sweetly and sweetly by him to behold.


10
When my love swears that she is made of truth,
I do believe her, though I know she lies,
That she might think me some untutored youth,
That she might have been a lover's wife,
That she might have been a lover's wife,


11
Two loves I have, of comfort and despair,
That like two spirits do suggest me still.
My better angel is a man right fair,
Who, in the midst of the world's things,
Is as a lover of the world's things,
And in the world's things is as a lover of me.
