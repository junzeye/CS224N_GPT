Those lips that Love's own hand did make
Breathed forth the sound that said "I hate"
To me that languished for her sake;
And when she was gone, I could not think
Of what I had said, and the tears I shed
Brought no consolation to me.
I was not so much troubled as I was
To think that she would not come again,
And I was not so much troubled as I was
To think that she would not come again,
For I knew that she would not come again,
And I knew that she would not come again.
And I knew that she would not come again,
And I knew that she would not come again,
And I knew that she would not come again,
And I knew that she would not come again,
And I knew that she would not come again,
And I knew that she would not come again,
And I knew that she would not come again,
And I knew that she would not come again,
And I knew that she would not come again,
And I knew that she would not come again,
And I knew that she would not come again,
And I knew that she would not come again,
And I knew that she would not come again,
And I knew that she would not come again,
And I knew that she would not

Poor soul, the center of my sinful earth,
Pressed with these rebel powers that thee array,
Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth,
As the wild beasts of the forest,
And, like a wild beast, thy heart is not fenced?
Thou hast lost thy mind, thou art not fit for this world,
Thou hast lost thy soul, thou art not fit for this world,
Thou art not fit for this world, thou art not fit for this world.
Thou art not fit for this world, thou art not fit for this world,
Thou art not fit for this world, thou art not fit for this world,
Thou art not fit for this world, thou art not fit for this world,
Thou art not fit for this world, thou art not fit for this world,
Thou art not fit for this world, thou art not fit for this world,
Thou art not fit for this world, thou art not fit for this world,
Thou art not fit for this world, thou art not fit for this world,
Thou art not fit for this world, thou art not fit for this world,
Thou art not fit for this world, thou art not fit for this world,
Thou art not fit for this world, thou art not fit for this world,

My love is as a fever, longing still
For that which longer nurseth the disease,
Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,
And is in some way the cause of it.
The love of a man is like a fever,
And the fever is the love of a man.
And the love of a woman is like a fever,
And the fever is the love of a woman.
And the love of a man is like a fever,
And the fever is the love of a man.
And the love of a woman is like a fever,
And the fever is the love of a woman.
And the love of a man is like a fever,
And the fever is the love of a man.
And the love of a woman is like a fever,
And the fever is the love of a woman.
And the love of a man is like a fever,
And the fever is the love of a man.
And the love of a woman is like a fever,
And the fever is the love of a woman.
And the love of a man is like a fever,
And the fever is the love of a man.
And the love of a woman is like a fever,
And the fever is the love of a woman.
And the love of a man is like a fever,
And the fever

O me, what eyes hath love put in my head,
Which have no correspondence with true sight!
Or if they have, where is my judgment fled,
To judge of the good or bad of this world?
How then can I be happy, if I do not know
My own thoughts, and my own judgments?
And if I know them, how can I judge of myself?
Or if I judge of myself, how can I know myself?
How then can I be happy, if I do not know myself?
How then can I be happy, if I do not know myself?
How then can I be happy, if I do not know myself?
How then can I be happy, if I do not know myself?
How then can I be happy, if I do not know myself?
How then can I be happy, if I do not know myself?
How then can I be happy, if I do not know myself?
How then can I be happy, if I do not know myself?
How then can I be happy, if I do not know myself?
How then can I be happy, if I do not know myself?
How then can I be happy, if I do not know myself?
How then can I be happy, if I do not know myself?
How then can I be happy, if I do not know

Canst thou, O cruel, say I love thee not
When I against myself with thee partake?
Do I not think on thee when I forgot thee?
I see thee, and I know thee not;
I am not thou, but I am thee,
And I am not I, but I am I.
I am thy, and thou art mine,
And I am thy, and thou art mine.
I am thy, and thou art mine,
And I am thy, and thou art mine.
I am thy, and thou art mine,
And I am thy, and thou art mine.
I am thy, and thou art mine,
And I am thy, and thou art mine.
I am thy, and thou art mine,
And I am thy, and thou art mine.
I am thy, and thou art mine,
And I am thy, and thou art mine.
I am thy, and thou art mine,
And I am thy, and thou art mine.
I am thy, and thou art mine,
And I am thy, and thou art mine.
I am thy, and thou art mine,
And I am thy, and thou art mine.
I am thy, and thou art mine,
And I am thy, and thou art mine.
I am thy, and thou art mine,

O, from what power hast thou this powerful might
With insufficiency my heart to sway?
To make me give the lie to my true sight,
I have not the power to do it.
But if thou wilt be my friend, and my friend
To me, and my friend to all,
And my friend to all, and my friend to all,
I will give thee the power to do it.
Thou canst not, I know, do it,
Nor canst thou, I know, do it,
But if thou wilt be my friend, and my friend
To me, and my friend to all,
And my friend to all, and my friend to all,
I will give thee the power to do it.
Thou canst not, I know, do it,
Nor canst thou, I know, do it,
But if thou wilt be my friend, and my friend
To me, and my friend to all,
And my friend to all, and my friend to all,
I will give thee the power to do it.
Thou canst not, I know, do it,
Nor canst thou, I know, do it,
But if thou wilt be my friend, and my friend
To me, and my friend to all,
And my friend to all,

Love is too young to know what conscience is;
Yet who knows not conscience is born of love?
Then, gentle cheater, urge not my amiss,
And let me not be the cause of your shame.
I have a soul to love, and a soul to die for.
My heart is not to be won or lost,
But my soul is to be lost.
My heart is to be lost, but my soul is to be won.
My heart is to be lost, but my soul is to be won.
My heart is to be lost, but my soul is to be won.
My heart is to be lost, but my soul is to be won.
My heart is to be lost, but my soul is to be won.
My heart is to be lost, but my soul is to be won.
My heart is to be lost, but my soul is to be won.
My heart is to be lost, but my soul is to be won.
My heart is to be lost, but my soul is to be won.
My heart is to be lost, but my soul is to be won.
My heart is to be lost, but my soul is to be won.
My heart is to be lost, but my soul is to be won.
My heart is to be lost, but my soul is to be won.

In loving thee thou know'st I am forsworn,
But thou art twice forsworn, to me love swearing;
In act thy bed-vow broke, and new faith torn,
I have sworn to thee that I will not go
To the world of men, but to thee alone.
I have sworn to thee, O Lord, that I will not go
To the world of men, but to thee alone.
I have sworn to thee, O Lord, that I will not go
To the world of men, but to thee alone.

Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep.
A maid of Dian's this advantage found,
And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep.
And in the morning he was the first to rise,
And to the little house his wife's maid
Had given him the morning's breakfast.
And with the maid's blessing he went to bed,
And when he had slept a little he rose,
And to the little house his wife's maid
Had given him the morning's breakfast.

And to the little house his wife's maid
Had given him the morning's breakfast.

The little love-god, lying once asleep,
Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,
Whilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to keep
Bought a sweetly sweetened morsel of his flesh.
The sweetest of all the sweet flowers that grow
In the garden of the goddess, were in his hand.
And when he had taken the sweetest of the flowers,
He took the flower from the flower's bosom,
And placed it in the flower's mouth.
And then the goddess, who had so long loved him,
That she had never ceased to love him,
Was filled with joy, and, with her sweet voice,
Gave her sweet praise, saying, "Thou art the flower
That I have loved for ever."

And placed it in the flower's mouth.

When my love swears that she is made of truth,
I do believe her, though I know she lies,
That she might think me some untutored youth,
And that I might not be the man that she loves.
But I will not be deceived, for I know
That she is made of truth, and that I am made
Of truth.
Now, I will tell you my story, for I am

Two loves I have, of comfort and despair,
That like two spirits do suggest me still.
