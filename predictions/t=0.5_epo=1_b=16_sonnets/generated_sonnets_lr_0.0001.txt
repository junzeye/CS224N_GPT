Those lips that Love's own hand did make
Breathed forth the sound that said "I hate"
To me that languished for her sake;
And my love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love

Canst thou, O cruel, say I love thee not
When I against myself with thee partake?
Do I not think on thee when I forgot thee,
Or do I not think on thee,
Or do I not think on thee when I am in thee?

O, from what power hast thou this powerful might
With insufficiency my heart to sway?
To make me give the lie to my true sight,
To make me a false witness of my true thoughts,
To make me a false witness of my true love,
To make me a false witness of my true love,
To make me a false witness of my true love,
To make me a false witness of my true love,
To make me a false witness of my true love,
To make me a false witness of my true love,
To make me a false witness of my true love,
To make me a false witness of my true love,
To make me a false witness of my true love,
To make me a false witness of my true love,
To make me a false witness of my true love,
To make me a false witness of my true love,
To make me a false witness of my true love,

Love is too young to know what conscience is;
Yet who knows not conscience is born of love?
Then, gentle cheater, urge not my amiss,
Or, if I be my own,
Or, if I be yours,
Or, if I be yours,
Or, if I be yours,
Or, if I be yours,
Or, if I be yours,
Or, if I be yours,
Or, if I be yours,
Or, if I be yours,
Or, if I be yours,
Or, if I be yours,

In loving thee thou know'st I am forsworn,
But thou art twice forsworn, to me love swearing;
In act thy bed-vow broke, and new faith torn,
And in love's love
I am forsworn.
And so,
That in thy love's love,
Thy love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love

Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep.
A maid of Dian's this advantage found,
And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep,
And the love-kindling fire did burn,
And the love-kindling fire burned,
And the love-kindling fire burned,
And the love-kindling fire burned,
And the love-kindling fire burned,
And the love-kindling fire burned,
And the love-kindling fire burned,
And the love-kindling fire burned,
And the love-kindling fire burned,
And the love-kindling fire burned,
And the love-kindling fire burned,
And the love-kindling fire burned,

And the love-kindling fire burned,
And the love-kindling fire burned,
And the love-kindling fire burned,

The little love-god, lying once asleep,
Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,
Whilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to keep their love-day,
And many that said,
"My love is my love,
And all my love is my love,
And all my love is my love,
And all my love is my love,
And all my love is my love.
And all my love is my love,
And all my love is my love,
And all my love is my love.
And all my love is my love,
And all my love is my love.
And all my love is my love,
And all my love is my love.
And all my love is my love,
And all my love is my love,
And all my love is my love.

When my love swears that she is made of truth,
I do believe her, though I know she lies,
That she might think me some untutored youth,
And I might be all my love's love's love,
And I might be all my love's love's love,
And all my love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's love's

Two loves I have, of comfort and despair,
That like two spirits do suggest me still.
My better angel is a man right fair,
And my worse angel is a woman's name.
The man's name,
And the woman's name,
That both do so well,
And that, in my good time,
That both do so well,
And that, in my bad time,
That both do so well.
That, in my good time,
And in my bad time,
That both do so well,
And that, in my good time,
And in my bad time,
That both do so well.
  That, in my good time,
  That both do so well.
  That, in my bad time,
  That both do so well.
