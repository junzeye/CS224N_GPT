Those lips that Love's own hand did make
Breathed forth the sound that said "I hate"
To me that languished for her sake;
And being expected of himself they told me,
Unto him their Host no longer dear;
I was lost and crying that he should think
Hence all else must lies in honour,
Which in to-morrow he sworne him no longer welcome.


1
Poor soul, the center of my sinful earth,
Pressed with these rebel powers that thee array,
Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth,
Till thou art captured and my gracious soul thine?
The soul that lives a fall, despiser of death,
My armor in the virtue of health, resplendent from sleep,
Thy lord, what villain shall overcome thee,
And near the heroes of heaven, thee and his valor?


2
My love is as a fever, longing still
For that which longer nurseth the disease,
Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,
Wherewith with grave perversity
Comes that which has no power to change,
Which, to cast off for the good of man,
Is lose when bring'd to misery.


3
O me, what eyes hath love put in my head,
Which have no correspondence with true sight!
Or if they have, where is my judgment fled,
Those points of truth and good I hath sight of?
It seems and I hope it in Heaven that my eye


4
Canst thou, O cruel, say I love thee not
When I against myself with thee partake?
Do I not think on thee when I forgot thee?


5
O, from what power hast thou this powerful might
With insufficiency my heart to sway?
To make me give the lie to my true sight,
I see not thee for these love-less summers;


6
Love is too young to know what conscience is;
Yet who knows not conscience is born of love?
Then, gentle cheater, urge not my amiss,
And one good heart may condemn and one noblest say,
The wise ruler's law or my fault?


7
In loving thee thou know'st I am forsworn,
But thou art twice forsworn, to me love swearing;
In act thy bed-vow broke, and new faith torn


8
Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep.
A maid of Dian's this advantage found,
And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep in the heat;
Dionysus, that all Elysium sing of,
Outlaid with the coffers of the gods his gifts doth ring,


9
The little love-god, lying once asleep,
Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,
Whilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to keep
Allured their lust in golden martlets and ravens.
Like fairy hope dreams till his divine love died,
And blissful hearts of graces face and ill-smitten wake,


10
When my love swears that she is made of truth,
I do believe her, though I know she lies,
That she might think me some untutored youth,
Old-fashioned even, but well trained.
So cut me still, wise Archidemus;
The Gods, but since the attempt has been made
To frame myself after you, Nature has let it grow
And give me another worthier shape.


11
Two loves I have, of comfort and despair,
That like two spirits do suggest me still.
My better angel is a man right fair,
Hath in his to charm every kind of woman,
 And things but falter my better won't be:
