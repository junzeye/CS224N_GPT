Those lips that Love's own hand did make
Breathed forth the sound that said "I hate"
To me that languished for her sake;
But of which canst thou best enjoy me;
Take thee a sweet bad of old;
Th'other doth  For him that lives at   I live;
For every tear, at my heart,
Which mine is.
  And this friend of mine
 


1
Poor soul, the center of my sinful earth,
Pressed with these rebel powers that thee array,
Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth,
Thou black, hate
O good, and dumb,
Thou lying in image's shape make of
Suffering's beggarer in this youth's scorn.
For thou nothing's worth do name
When thy accursed mine ink can keep to it.


2
My love is as a fever, longing still
For that which longer nurseth the disease,
Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,
Willing to appear in healthful treatment or daily bestow,
And pleas'rous season which burns on other worthier things and to bad be thought then his worth.


3
O me, what eyes hath love put in my head,
Which have no correspondence with true sight!
Or if they have, where is my judgment fled,
How dumb
And loose of meaning
How long time on thy mote is once caught,
In whose opposition I mad grief,
Douching proof,
By diffidence, like thin shade,
So long that most of mine eye is out-set with a picture of the score of our greatest poem,
—
But yet that picture much have I,, too much of me, given to thee,
Vaster are thy works,
—
And small of thy claim
A fearful picture

Canst thou, O cruel, say I love thee not
When I against myself with thee partake?
Do I not think on thee when I forgot thee?
Seen on that head
Above the world's woe,
So highest and thou livest is fair from Hell,
My woe or is all love's,
So praise to thee better, not more,
So much show of love's sweet
Than mightier high except may themselves array in the house of sorrow
Or blanc'd to doom.


5
O, from what power hast thou this powerful might
With insufficiency my heart to sway?
To make me give the lie to my true sight,
To make them appear more true with their large plumed visages,
To make such a trick
In time of war and time of peace.
Since this time doth from infancy appear mine,
Now I know that the law is full of my love,
And that it is but to make itself for my pleasure.
  You choose, foolish man,
  Saving my soul, to do wrong th'entirely

Love is too young to know what conscience is;
Yet who knows not conscience is born of love?
Then, gentle cheater, urge not my amiss,
Which then the world can boast?
Imagin'd enemy of my country still thee,
By him seem'st no stronger shows.
Thy comparison is old and dear.
In this comparison
Be what thou best wouldst,
Such as thou bearest?
So being mine,
He's still mine.
Till, sweetest child
Be thy self,
Thy present love
When in truth thou art.  So far, then,
  However this place,
  In like view to the length.


7
In loving thee thou know'st I am forsworn,
But thou art twice forsworn, to me love swearing;
In act thy bed-vow broke, and new faith torn;
And
Whereas not love will be in thee,
For
I am utter on my returning here
In
An utter joy
Without you,
A witless endeavour like to you's;
For
When thou art gone,
End so not so,
Which thou,' heark may protest,
Cant rain that dries
Thy face.

Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep.
A maid of Dian's this advantage found,
And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep with thy smell
To give life to his flame;
And also to lead him to a passing phase for whereforth after, having sold his soul,
Nor perhaps should he come,
A wenderer with thee,
Than all the use of his time,
Nor all the shelf of his time;
How
How form'st thou in them,
Whether doth his worth, or whether he thrive'st not.


9
The little love-god, lying once asleep,
Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,
Whilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to keep thee,
Desire'd Death to sing,

Which sleep's light and sleep's sad a poet put
Then, like causeless numbers
That bless a mother by no deceivour.
Those left out th'
A far greater praise deserve'd.
By another condition thou, say, sweet outwardness,
Save me,
Th'A how-a-king said,


Five such things,
Though she in value give
So much more.


10
When my love swears that she is made of truth,
I do believe her, though I know she lies,
That she might think me some untutored youth, and do my utmost best though she deceit,
And only that I would change my mind,
Pleasing her according to her lies.

In this

Of truth-keeper I do see.
From him lies man's will all
Last:
That I believe not myself.
There is no way but to look upon him like this.
Let me not be here a fugitive,
That another give me can stay his thought.


11
Two loves I have, of comfort and despair,
That like two spirits do suggest me still.
My better angel is a man right fair,
Pitying many being so eager,
And now your better spot, too, turning on you with such lightness to animate his growth,
As shall make his praise manifest and
That you may see the least astonishment on my part.
With spirit and words a sharp sharp cord is set to my utterance,
For very near called,
And I, whose in bones your praise needs
Would make war,
A bait to your fondness your taunt.
And neither does,
Nor too yet will I in things your mind can devise.
So busy busy that I am to you,
Wasting your loving thoughts on them not.
