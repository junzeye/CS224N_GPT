Those lips that Love's own hand did make
Breathed forth the sound that said "I hate"
To me that languished for her sake;
And those hands did hold me captive,
When beauty's tears and love's love were joined,
While it would make a mockery of my sickness
And sire was willing to take my life.
'Look not into her hidden eye,
Your sleep of repose is there;
Behold it, she will surely show
That war not is her nurse's birth.
'The desire of her country is there,
Which would sooner drive her to war
That love's hand-made star should inflict.
'And if she was in one sense good,
Yet love had that child in him,

Poor soul, the center of my sinful earth,
Pressed with these rebel powers that thee array,
Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth,
And waste my joy? I show thee a mild loving age,
For thy sable acts betray thy infancy.
Thou risest alone from my blindness,
And liveth and winst my childish charms.
All ersatz sorrow doth grow sweet to thee;
But know this, who loves thee not as the lily,
Or which with thee are swept away.
In these rare energies thou livest.
The noise of thy dying breathing ersatz 
The force of thy life is strong and doth not fade;
And though the head is hewn from thy ears,

My love is as a fever, longing still
For that which longer nurseth the disease,
Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,
And are still to be dost eat'd at the expiration,
And feel yet the stalks of the day better fresh.
No aisles of our groves is o'erstuffed
Like the hands of savory pickling cakes.
Those which have an unwholesome taste,
The fuller grows, and faster takes root;
But they only decay and lose their oil,
In those nourish'd by loathsome ingredients.
You, in the graceful bed of my sun,
Will pass your days like a plant of purple
Drifted of dull vegetable soil,
When

O me, what eyes hath love put in my head,
Which have no correspondence with true sight!
Or if they have, where is my judgment fled,
And where the shadow of the thistle of your eyes
Has that most proud evidence? Which, if nature,
On observing beauty sees, tak not to show
Those points that do seem perfect to your eyes,
But looks at the very source whence nature steals
To be counterfeited by so refined a form.
Whoso follows not the ways of truth,
And how ever can imitate her most excellent
Is in truth flat, and cannot raise himself above
To think the holier part of him.
 And thus true beauty, being added unto an eye,
 Has makes you think that that

Canst thou, O cruel, say I love thee not
When I against myself with thee partake?
Do I not think on thee when I forgot?
When I feed you with my grief for thy losing,
Though more than one doth I feign to love,
And think myself good to live where thou dost now?
What changes of fortune have made thee well,
Who if I knew and knew and knew thy thoughts,
Would from artless freedom make me say
When I would love thee more than me,
And being chaste have fled to no joy,
If ever thy heart were those who thine own?"
O thou, sweet father, answer:

O, from what power hast thou this powerful might
With insufficiency my heart to sway?
To make me give the lie to my true sight,
For that I should cease to see him?
"Now, therefore, thou art my friend;
"The evils that thou knowest are thy defence,
"And fortune confuses by what way thou art
"By his necessities th' deceitful mockery;
"In truth, thou art sure, O friend of mine,
"That thou hast thy life and thy tears to keep,
"For who can do evil without a double?
"He that must put off like a damsel,
"Is doth his limbs, who hath the power to bear,
"Doubt his face and his

Love is too young to know what conscience is;
Yet who knows not conscience is born of love?
Then, gentle cheater, urge not my amiss,
Or is I most unguarded, unless love demands it?
And how may I not snatch the city of my heart,
Or perish a slave in my love?
Then 'tis true I have learnt that feeling;
But how, by amends, can I hope to attain
To an immortal bliss so sweetly spent?
If by true amends can I rest
And make amends for once doing a wrong?
And will not my peace prove so much sweet,
That the world may ever consume and waste,
Or make him at last not so much an enemy
As he is already when

In loving thee thou know'st I am forsworn,
But thou art twice forsworn, to me love swearing;
In act thy bed-vow broke, and new faith torn
My first love a fraud for holy love;
And that in beauty thou verily knewst not;
In kindness how the conscience of life
Wrest from me a haughty sense;
And before the promise wherewith love brings thee
So fair, unlook'd after in beauty.
With all its pride did it poison my soul,
By cutting in at times its glory through my heart;
And therefore, second to thy misery,
I bid thee cling here in my home.
Tell me how this happiness which I love,
I care for not so much for my reason,
Till

Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep.
A maid of Dian's this advantage found,
And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep,
Although he himself trembled, and both his eyes
Deserted his chamber's light, and chanced
To smile at these images that spake.
A new love then began to agitate
The wise housekeeper's mind, and unfelt
A piece of cunning that justly moved
The frail maiden's tender love.
And it seemed, she said, this rule of love
Should be employed upon her, when of all
He was the less to bear her exquisite praise
To such as saw not this maiden's beauty.
"Thus once indeed," she said, "I could
Be

The little love-god, lying once asleep,
Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,
Whilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to keep,
Farr'd lov'd with that confessor's high price.
Yet, thou, O king, forswear thyself, thy golden wealth,
Nor guard thyself, my love's mate, with precious gifts.
For with hearts full of so dearly spent blood
Life in all things doth stand, old as thou art.
Outrages it, then, by thy wealth, if thou tak'st
The costly gift of life from rich men,
Who in love are own guards, and equal wrong.
For they are thy wives, and all that friend's beauty doth in

When my love swears that she is made of truth,
I do believe her, though I know she lies,
That she might think me some untutored youth,
For any word is so fleeting in beauty
Which friends doth not search and one way doth not lead.
Some doth make such head and nose as twine
Out of wit with which every creature doth rise,
But all that grows down out of love is not beauty.
Fairness doth not live so well as grace,
Neither does it live with such beauty so long,
But when man comes, he needs to love this art,
And all else that loves good, stammers for the sin.
But all that doth love beauty doth love more,
In point of

Two loves I have, of comfort and despair,
That like two spirits do suggest me still.
My better angel is a man right fair,
Who might have my love if I should lie:
But love can never consent to my being,
And will no longer beg of love,
But always perchance herself love,
Whose pretty life doth make, be self-just,
And love what she lives! When I live, in her joy,
I think my thought was frivolous and light,
That my good could then usefully be;
Yet of these thoughts I often praise her full often
Who be very true to herself:
That every mother could confess
How happy was her child, and mingle
Her love with that of
