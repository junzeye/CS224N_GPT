Those lips that Love's own hand did make
Breathed forth the sound that said "I hate"
To me that languished for her sake;
So shall this pleasure dull against my love
As I "ave hold of to the blemish'ring blood
As strong a foothold as a wall,
Let their true love thu' it be remembered.
My love, cherub To hold the shining kisses I hold,
Or hold the aching day with his strings.
 This heart from love is kind of constant;
"But when he hears his heart come back to me
May he again say, 'What do you love?
 'Why dost thou wilt bear me in thy love?
  And if thou love's fault for me,
  I will bear thee true love by thy naught.
  I prove not thy self,  But thy love's cruelty is a slight
  To my love's self.


1
Poor soul, the center of my sinful earth,
Pressed with these rebel powers that thee array,
Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth,
As when thy sweet love cries out thyself,
Give a wailing prayer! I refuse thee else
Thy beauty to the sad beint cast out,
Hath so been born in those sweet hearts,
The stain of thy love, the stain on thy godly part.
Unhappily in this likeness give godly love,
Now with thy great heart bring me on thy waste.
 Where thou foisted me, thou hast yet love.
To an old age I love an old man thy love knows,
 But for thee love's bad lesson thy master should teach.


2
My love is as a fever, longing still
For that which longer nurseth the disease,
Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,
At such age, was that wretched dead boy's life
That left him in such restless place.
So, though I gave them,
To be one with him and his mind,
To live in his own burial where he seems to live.
  I travel not far, though alive.



3
O me, what eyes hath love put in my head,
Which have no correspondence with true sight!
Or if they have, where is my judgment fled,
And hope with thine eyes and hearing how time?
How I see them, where love and wonder?
How love changes and paints my mettle:
And how it in all ages wrought right,
A man perceiving his bow come
But not straying, ever once seen him.
That in the end love, then, what god dost I love,
Who dwells over love that imitates.
And so knowing then by heart
Will first answer, and then sing unto him.
  Yet often it does, and might not verse;
  Such what love dost do love en'light
  To cast out all that is bitter;
  That which bears loving memory
  Today saney, and dwells on the seven days with you.



4
Canst thou, O cruel, say I love thee not
When I against myself with thee partake?
Do I not think on thee when I forgot thee
Which was that new crowned with this badge of honor
To bring thee away so worthy,
Or after thy being honoured of mine own
To make him nor punish or forgive.
If thou find what thyself worth
Or shall give away of worth, I, thou dearest man,
Thou art content to do what I give, but what shall I gain
If I are thus deemed worthy.
Thou art not, then, drunk with wisdom,
That haply yet my heavenly power can draw
From me immortal creatures and immortal men to call this praise.



5
O, from what power hast thou this powerful might
With insufficiency my heart to sway?
To make me give the lie to my true sight,
Which thou dost lie slovenly to thee;
When I behold thou straightout for all want
The mortal worth in thy heart,
Which art short you draw;
Thy virtue's true gains, the true gains of thine
To whomever thou dost abuse,
That thou wert more natural than thy mortal breath.
  I cannot boast of thee,
  I am the result of thy self.
  After all that, thou must do that one favor
  When thou gives that one favor to thee,
  But thou, too, surely shall be placed.


6
Love is too young to know what conscience is;
Yet who knows not conscience is born of love?
Then, gentle cheater, urge not my amiss,
That where do you all love?
Nor love should you speak of his hate,
When you show in love,
That love's stain, converted from love,
Could soften his heart and cure his name.
As for him that says: thou love now thyself,
 but without of thee bear weakness;
  Thou of understanding thirsting on thy art's righteousness
  To make all thy blood and glories
  Wear none others' love's treasures
  Losing heaven at thy doors would be a crime



7
In loving thee thou know'st I am forsworn,
But thou art twice forsworn, to me love swearing;
In act thy bed-vow broke, and new faith torn;
Whilst my promise is broken, again my love's vows in everlasting way,
That I may never again lie with love in the face of death,
Or sing praise of heaven on a ere this style do approach.


8
Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep.
A maid of Dian's this advantage found,
And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep,
Of beauty with sweetness and beauty rose,
Like sweet delight of love."
As it grew longer
How his heart rose, how it fell.
Then grew much joy,
And further were all time more sensible than his love,
Though short I had yours to bare
Yet had your best being traced.


9
The little love-god, lying once asleep,
Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,
Whilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to keep,
Spoiled when it dies with love is born,
Which war's most sane decree built against
Who did maintain in life such silent abominations.
When thy breezes to thy bent
Till your holy days, thou art the choirmaster,
For thy love much that I fear, thy most sure
And my sweet love it hath promised to thee,
Upon whose wind you build a false heaven,
And thou part with thy lesser enemies to thy deep self,
Yet thou shalt live, though thee die, still alive.
  Likewise thou shalt bear by yourself thou little child
  Be my love, but do all I love thee, to me I live,
  Even in cruel prison thou hast borne;
  And thy countenance in goodness thou'st dead.



10
When my love swears that she is made of truth,
I do believe her, though I know she lies,
That she might think me some untutored youth,
And often say, 'One day a gore-black rose,'
Which is the most daring addition
To My loving feeling.
If by love's witty writing thou,
It blounds, I know that thou must never behold
To my a flower. To kill, thou wilt be back,
When I tell that I give myself a mortal wound.
Whither love's whilest thee, thou blindest,
Then keeps not thy way in thy hate,
Which thou wilt remember not in thy love what thou dost.


11
Two loves I have, of comfort and despair,
That like two spirits do suggest me still.
My better angel is a man right fair,
Caring to grow life to grace;
Even as I must give my soul away.
Of all the death and other war's profane art
Though live I never am
The most generous war prince on earth,
As every kind of love I love bestows thee
To fill up my beauty.
What war which you endure is not eternal.
You hope to make beauty to grieve,
So that we shall all break with your exaltation.
And, to this end do as thou hast more love
To gain by unselfish love.
  Tame thy beauty by thee what was stulled
  Though thou make my rage grow.
