Thine eyes I love, and they, as pitying me,
Knowing thy heart torment me with disdain,
Have put on black, and loving mourners be,
And thine bright God put on thy own.


1
Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan
For that deep wound it gives my friend and me.
Is 't not enough to torture me alone,
Those fingers, though iron, still prove themselves,
For was not there his ease in love's spot,
He should never seek or pine for my pain
Till I tired him it or young looked elsewhere."
........................................................

Good Husband,
If love is gone, no hurt is strong;



2
So, now I have confessed that he is thine
And I myself am mortgaged to thy will,
Myself I'll forfeit, so that other mine,
Which is my soul alone, I could give,
But by thy means I'll obtain the other's.


3
Whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy will,
And will to boot, and will in overplus.
More than enough am I that vex thee still,
For this world and all things in it.


4
If thy soul check thee that I come so near,
Swear to thy blind soul that I was thy will,
And will, thy soul knows, is admitted there.


5
Thou blind fool, Love, what dost thou to mine eyes
That they behold and see not what they see?
They know what beauty is, see where it lies,
But know not why it is so; not understanding
That beauty is not the same through all the times;
For beauty thou only dost fain perceive,
But due to time it well knoweth not, nor doth it
Know, nor the wise reason thereof.


6
When my love swears that she is made of truth
I do believe her though I know she lies,
That she might think me some untutored youth,
When she is the swift lover of sound and fashion
Leaves pure face and drops sweet hair upon my brow
Those she loves she love to love I know to love;
And this of myself I know to love,
For when she my best daughter is bidden to kiss,


7
O, call not me to justify the wrong
That thy unkindness lays upon my heart;
Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue;
Mould not in thy anger deceive thine enemy
Struck by thy misbasure, and deny him his right.


8
Be wise as thou art cruel; do not press
My tongue-tied patience with too much disdain,
Lest sorrow lend me words, and words express my thought;
For mercy's sake didst preserve not my good name."


9
In faith, I do not love thee with mine eyes,
For they in thee a thousand errors note;
But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise,
From thine no more he prefers me, But mine.'



10
Love is my sin, and thy dear virtue hate,
Hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving.
O, but with mine compare thou thine own state,
Though all thy blessedness be gale and flood,


11
Lo, as a careful huswife runs to catch
One of her feathered creatures broke away,
Sets down her babe, and makes all swift dispatch
Of the suitors and outlanders feasting and merry;
While heart-stirring, in a low quiet bosom
Of wondrous story in e'er Friday night's day
Threads the eternal night, when fancies seem to form
All airs of singleness, good and evil.
